Welcome to Tetris! 

This is the final project for my Fundamentals of Computer Science I class. The game is programmed in Dr Racket, an educative coding language that is also a modern derivation of Lisp. 

Play this bin-packing game/tetris by rotating the blocks with the 'a' and 'd' keys, and moving them side to side with the left and right keys on the keyboard! Once you've completed the game, the game will tell you how many blocks you used.
